Python Learning Roadmap - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFEC7VbWBZo

## Data types & variables

- The first step, in any programming language, is to understand the types of data we can work with.
- To store these data, we use **variables**
- The main data types are:
  - integer (whole number)
  - float (floating point number)
  - string
  - boolean
- Advanced data types include:
  - tuple
  - list
  - dictionary

## Methods & operators

- After learning the data types, we need to understand what we can do with them.
- Methods are built-in functions that are available for a specific data type
- Operators are symbols we use to run arithmetic and logical operations

## Control flow operations

Next we need to understand the control flow operations.
- we need ways to control the execution of our code
- in Python, we use conditional statements, for loops, and while loops

## Functions
