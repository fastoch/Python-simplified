Python Learning Roadmap - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFEC7VbWBZo

## Data types & variables

- The first step, in any programming language, is to understand the types of data we can work with.
- To store these data, we use **variables**
- The main data types are:
  - integer (whole number)
  - float (floating point number)
  - string
  - boolean
- Advanced data types include:
  - tuple
  - list
  - dictionary

## Methods & operators

- After learning the data types, we need to understand what we can do with them.
- Methods are built-in functions that are available for a specific data type
- Operators are symbols we use to run arithmetic and logical operations

## Control flow operations

Next we need to understand the control flow operations.
- we need ways to control the execution of our code
- in Python, we use conditional statements, for loops, and while loops

## Functions

Keep your code DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself).  
A function is a block of code you can reuse at will so you don't have to repeat yourself.

## Classes and Objects

Classes are quite similar to functions, but instead of focusing on the task, we actually bundle the task along with  
the data required to perform the task. Classes are basically **blueprints** that allow us to create objects.

## Basic Python modules

- **NumPy**: deals with mathematical operations
- **pandas**: helps us organize and manipulate data
- **matplotlib**: creates scientific graphs and plots 

## Everything else!

From this point, the rest of your journey is entirely up to you.  
- if you're interested in **machine learning**, try **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**
- for building **bots** and **process automation** in general, try **Selenium** or **Beautiful soup**
- to develop mobile applications with Python, you can try **kivy** or **kivyMD**
- for **web development**, you can use **Django** or **Flask**
- to develop **desktop applications**, there is **Tkinter** or **PyQt5**
